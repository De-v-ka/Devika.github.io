## Projects

### Crime Detection
Built a machine learning model to detect threatening messages using SMS datasets. Applied SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes classifiers with text preprocessing techniques to achieve high precision and F1-scores.

### Emotion Detection from Images
Developed a CNN-based model using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify facial expressions into seven emotion categories. Enhanced performance through data augmentation and dropout regularization.

### SMS Spam Classification
Implemented an **SVM model** with **TF-IDF vectorization** to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam. Achieved high accuracy by optimizing the pipeline with stop-word removal and lemmatization.

### DNS Security and Phishing Detection
Engineered a machine learning solution using **TabNet** for domain threat detection, employing feature engineering, SMOTE oversampling, and ensemble learning methods.

### Resume Screening Automation
Built an NLP model using **TF-IDF** and **KNeighbors Classifier** to automatically categorize resumes into different job categories for streamlined recruitment.

### **Carpooling in Disaster Response**
Developed a **Python-based simulation** for coordinating carpooling in disaster response scenarios, utilizing synthetic data to assign disaster victims to the nearest shelters. Features **spatial clustering, transport grouping, and visualized connections** on a Folium map with a color-coded legend for transport groups.

### **Agent-Based Social Behavior Simulation**
Built a **Python-based Agent-Based Model (ABM)** simulating social behavior dynamics in a grid environment, where agents interact and influence each other's states (**Neutral, Social, Antisocial**) over time.
